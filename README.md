# Leibniz Integral Rule (Measure-Theoretic Proof)

This repository contains a rigorous proof of differentiation under the integral sign
(Leibniz Integral Rule) in a general measure-theoretic setting.

## Content

The document proves continuity, differentiability, and partial differentiability of
parameter-dependent integrals using the Dominated Convergence Theorem.

More precisely, the following results are established:

- Continuity of the map  
  \[
  x \mapsto \int_\Omega f(x,\omega)\, d\mu(\omega)
  \]
- Differentiation under the integral sign for one real parameter
- Partial differentiation under the integral sign in \(\mathbb{R}^p\)

All proofs are written in a precise and explicit style, with full hypotheses stated.

## Mathematical Setting

- \((\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mu)\) is a measure space
- Functions take values in \(\mathbb{R}\)
- Integrability is understood in the Lebesgue sense
- Differentiability is treated pointwise and justified via domination
