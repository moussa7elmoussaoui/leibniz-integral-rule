# Leibniz Integral Rule

This repository contains a rigorous proof of the Leibniz Integral Rule,
also known as differentiation under the integral sign.

The proof is written in a general measure-theoretic framework and uses
standard tools from real analysis and Lebesgue integration.

## Content

The document studies functions that depend on a parameter and shows how
continuity and differentiability can be transferred inside the integral.

The following topics are covered:

- Continuity of parameter-dependent integrals
- Differentiation under the integral sign for one real variable
- Partial differentiation under the integral sign in several variables
- Use of domination arguments and convergence theorems

All assumptions are stated explicitly and all proofs are written in a
detailed and rigorous way.

## Mathematical Context

- General measure spaces
- Real-valued functions
- Lebesgue integrability
- Pointwise differentiability
- Justification using domination conditions
